# work-day-scheduler

## Description

-A web app to help you plan your day. 

- I took this project on to learn how to use Jquery syntax and to learn how to use day.js. 
- This site will help a user plan their work day, from 9-5. The site will update the current day and the hour and update the time blocks according to that data. The site will also let the user save tasks for their day and save those tasks into local storage. 
- I learned many things on this project: How to use Jquery syntax to target HTML elements, rewrite those elements, and how to use the ids of certain elements to help loop through local storage.
